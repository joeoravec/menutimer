# MenuTimer

A menu timing application. Built on top of [ngBoilerplate](http://joshdmiller.github.com/ng-boilerplate).

***


## About MenuTimer

MenuTimer is a sample AngularJS application.

### Roadmap

* Update ngBoilerplate -- get the latest with update versions of angular, bootstrap, etc.
* Make the link with the user's current menu items available to copy/paste, email, etc.
* Add backend storage
* Add menu name
* Display current time, time left to go, etc.




## Quick Start -- from ngBoilerplate

Install Node.js and then:

```sh
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ grunt watch
```

Finally, open `build/index.html` in your browser.

When you're ready to push your app into production, just run the `compile`
command:

```sh
$ grunt compile
```

This will concatenate and minify your sources and place them by default into the
`bin/` directory. There will only be three files: `index.html`,
`your-app-name.js`, and `your-app-name.css`. All of the vendor dependencies like
Bootstrap styles and AngularJS itself have been added to them for super-easy
deploying. If you use any assets (`src/assets/`) then they will be copied to
`bin/` as is.

Lastly, a complete build is always available by simply running the default
task, which runs `build` and then `compile`:

```sh
$ grunt
```
